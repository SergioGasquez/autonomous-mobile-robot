# Autonomous Mobile Robot
Project similar to MIT duckie town where the robot has to drive through the city in an autonomous way taking into account lanes directions, stop signs. The developed planning algorithm was A$*$, odometry implements Euler integration while control manages to drive the robot through the plan generated by A$*$
